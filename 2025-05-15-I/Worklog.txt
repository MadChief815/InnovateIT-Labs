In this implementation, I enhanced the loan submission flow by integrating an optional SMS notification feature. After a loan is successfully added, the app checks if the user has granted permission to send SMS messages to customers. If not, the app prompts the user with an alert asking for consent. This preference is securely stored using Expoâ€™s SecureStore for future submissions. If permission is granted, the app sends the loan details (such as customer name, loan amount, and due date) to a backend endpoint (/loans/send-sms/) that is responsible for dispatching the SMS. This ensures a streamlined, permission-aware experience while keeping sensitive user preferences safe.
