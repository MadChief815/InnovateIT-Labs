In this implementation, I have used expo-secure-store to manage screen refresh logic across navigations in a React Native app. Specifically, we set flags like loan_added, loan_deleted, new_customer_added, and customer_deleted in SecureStore whenever the user adds or deletes data on a different screen. Then, in the main screens (like the customerlist or customerinfo), I have added a navigation.addListener("focus", ...) to check these flags on screen focus. If any of the flags are set, the screen will re-fetch the data accordingly and reset the flags to prevent unnecessary reloads. This ensures the UI stays up to date only when needed, without refreshing after every back navigation, improving both performance and user experience.
